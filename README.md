## Dataset

 In this work, we contribute a large, realistic, and comprehensive high-quality dataset for safety clothing and helmets detection dataset.

- Each instance in TCRSF is annotated by the six professional security inspectors. After annotation, three graduate students who are not involved in the labeling process were invited to review the annotations, ensuring that every image and every annotation in the dataset is completely accurate.

- TCRSF dataset contains a total of 12373  images(9898 for training, 2475 for testing), including 7 categories  namely, 'Person','Safety Helmet','Other Clothing','Safety Clothing','Head','Burred Head',' Blurred Clothing'

- Comparison of existing open-source helmets dataset.
